        <item>And so, the dark knight Cecil was stripped of his command as the captain of the Red Wings. Final Fantasy IV, titled Final Fantasy II in its initial North American release, is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Its Active Time Battle system was used in five subsequent Final Fantasy games, and unlike prior games in the series, IV gave each character their own unchangeable character class â€” although at a few points in the story, a dark knight will choose the path of a paladin, or a summoner will evolve to a new tier of spellcasting.</item>
